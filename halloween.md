@ACTNUM: PROLOGUE

@LOCATIONlightslab2: DR. LIGHT'S LAB

Arrietty Sad: Pleaasssee?

Light Annoyed: No.

Arrietty Angry: Come on!!

Light Annoyed: **[sigh]** I said no, it means no, Arrietty.

Arrietty Annoyed: Seriously, what's the problem?

Light Angry: Because last year you all made a gigantic mess and it took poor Auto *weeks* to clean up the place.

Arrietty Angry: What? Now you're just making up excuses, we've only been living with you for a *few months* at most.

Light Annoyed: Well, the answer is still no and that is final.

Arrietty Angry: Alright, fine. **[slams the door on her way out]** Stuck up old geezer, the heck is his problem lately?

Molly Sad: I take it Dr. Light didn't take it well seeing you setting up the Halloween party, huh?

Arrietty Sad: Yeah, so much effort for that… Guess we can try again next year.

Molly Happy: Not so fast! We can find somewhere else to party!

Arrietty: Huh? How should we go about that?

Molly: Easy! We find a really scary looking place and party there. Like a true Halloween party!

Arrietty Shocked: Scary looking place? Like a graveyard? A haunted castle? A haunted graveyard castle?

Molly Smug: You aren't scared, are you Arri?

Arrietty Happy: Oh hell no, I am so down for that idea actually!

Molly Happy: Great! Let's gather up a few folks and search for a scary party location, then we can party there!

Arrietty: I have someone in mind already. Hey, Silver!

%Silver Dime splashes out of the Punch Bowl.

Molly Shocked: **[startled]** *Y-YAGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!*

OniSilver: **[all calm and collected]** Greetings. How may I assist you?

Molly Annoyed: **[clutching her chest, calming herself]** N-Next time please have a less startling entrance…

OniSilver Happy: My apologies, Molly. I have been practicing my scare as a fearsome Oni.

Arrietty: It sure seem to have worked on her. **[giggles]**

Arrietty Happy: Anyways, Dimey… Would you like to help the both of us find a totally spooky place for our party?

OniSilver Happy: My scouting would provide enough to find us such a place. I'm more than glad to be of your assistance.

Molly Happy: Great! I'll rally up the rest of the team.

Arrietty Happy: Great idea, and I'll ask Roy to drive us. Let's throw us one killer Halloween Party!

%End of Prologue

@ACTNUM: ACT 1

@LOCATION: ABANDONED ROUTE

%Being disallowed from partying at Light's, the Cyborg Resistance has agreed that Arrietty and co. should find a new party location for the whole team. Roy Jackson, the team's Magma Man and also their driver, only agrees to help out under the condition the search doesn't take too long as the rest of the team needs to finish their last minute costume shopping.

WitchArrietty: **[holding her map filled with dozens of locations marked red crosses]** Well, this one has to be it then. Let's stop at this place. **[points at an unmarked cemetary with an abandoned mysterious building]**

Magma0: This is lookin' to be the last stop, alright. The second time we doubled back to the first three stops really drained this thing's juice!

WitchArrietty Sad: Whoops! Sorry that I've gotten a little carried away!

Magma0 Happy: That's alright, kiddo; this thing was built for racing, it's not quite used to chauffeuring yet. Gonna have to give ol' Cerberus' car battery a tune-up after I drop the others off at the mall.

OniSilver: I take it us three are the only ones prepared ahead of time?

UlalaMolly: I don't see you wearing anything right now, though.

OniSilver Happy: Of course I am. I'm an Oni this year.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: …By just gluing two large candy corns on your forehead?

OniSilver Happy: It is an effective low-cost Halloween costume.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: I see…

%Soon, the team finally arrives at what is hopefully their ideal destination.

UlalaMolly Happy: Oh! There it is!

%In a distance, there is a huge decayed looking castle behind the graveyard. Then a flash of lightning from the clouds spooks Molly.

WitchArrietty Shocked: Look at the size of that castle!

UlalaMolly Shocked: C-Castle?! You didn't say there would be an abandoned castle!

WitchArrietty Smug: Oh, now are *you* chickening out?

UlalaMolly: Don't be silly. I-I was just shocked that there would be a castle out here!

Magma0 Annoyed: Now what in the- what's a castle doing out here? Do you folks think it's... *haunted* or somethin'?

WitchArrietty Happy: **[Getting off of the car with Molly and Silver]** Don't know, but we're going to investigate this place to make sure it's all good.

Magma0: Alright, don't get too scared! I’ll come back with the rest of the team when they’re done shopping. Be safe you three!

%With that, Roy's car speeds off the scene, leaving the three at a huge graveyard with the castle in its surrounding. Soon, the three walk across the graveyard approaching the castle.

Cyorown: **[squawks in the distance]**

UlalaMolly Sad: **[looking around the surroundings, surveying a very unsettling atmosphere]** This is looking like w-what we've wanted, huh?

WitchArrietty Happy: **[pumps fist into the air]** Heck yeah! I can already feel a chill down my spine! Are you as excited as I am?

UlalaMolly Happy: Of course! This was my idea after all! **[smiles hesitantly]**

UlalaMolly Sad: …But you know, despite that, this does feel like an amoral idea now that we're in a graveyard.

WitchArrietty: Sure, if we were to party on the graves. That's why the castle caught my eye instead, to party indoors instead!

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Don't know if it's that much better...

OniSilver: **[surveying the area around himself]** I sense this place has not seen any visitors in a while.

UlalaMolly: Even the worn down castle aside?

OniSilver: **[nods]** Not a single grave we've passed so far are dated within the past several decades…

UlalaMolly Shocked: **[Reading the year date of each passing tombstone, confirming Silver Dime's claims]** O-oh… How about that?

WitchArrietty: Oh, good observation! That might be a long abandoned graveyard then.

OniSilver: That is correct.

WitchArrietty Happy: Which means no one's ever around, we can party as long as we want!

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Yeahhhh, I don't think that was his point.

WitchArrietty: What was it then?

OniSilver Happy: It was just a simple observation. Nothing more.

UlalaMolly: Oh…

WitchArrietty Smug: You don't think there's actually such thing as ghosts and the like do you, Molly?

WitchArrietty Happy: I mean, not that I would complain!

UlalaMolly Happy: Of course not! T-That's not scientific at all! Why would I believe in such silly supernatural non-sense?

WitchArrietty Happy: Oh man, that would be *so* cool though! We'd be having the Halloween adventure of a life time!

UlalaMolly Sad: **[concerned laughter]** Hahaha… *Really into* the Halloween spirit, Arri?

%Eventually, they've finally reach to the ends of the grave yard and are right at the entrance of the castle. Excitedly, Arrietty opens the door and walks right in without much of a concern. Silver Dime follows with caution and then beckons to Molly who reluctantly enters the aged building.

WitchArrietty: Well, there it is! Our potential party place!

UlalaMolly: T-that's great! Looks scary enough for our p-party.

WitchArrietty: Well, we have yet to explore to be sure, but it is promising already!

UlalaMolly: Haha. Well, I'm about to head back and wait for everyone else while you-

WitchArrietty Annoyed: Nuh-uh! You're not cowarding your way out of this! **[slams the door and immediately the door knob falls off and rolls into a hole in the floor]** 

WitchArrietty Shocked: Oops?

UlalaMolly Shocked: W-Wha?! Arri! You've broke our only way out!

WitchArrietty Angry: I didn't even slam the door that hard!

OniSilver: **[looking around his surroundings]** Hmmm... The age of this place... It seems most unstable. While there may not be any hostile threat, we must still be cautious.

UlalaMolly Shocked: **[frantically looking around for an exit]** All the windows are boarded up too! We're trapped in here!

WitchArrietty: Calm yourself! There can be a backdoor exit or something. Besides, if we reallly need to, we can just transform and blow up the door anyways.

UlalaMolly Sad: Somehow I have an inkling it's not going to be that simple...

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: **Kyeh Heh Heh!!** What do we have here?

UlalaMolly Shocked: Zoinks!

WitchArrietty Shocked: Jinkies!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Do I hear yet another bunch of foolish kids trespassing my domain?

WitchArrietty Angry: Kids? I'm 26 thank you very much!

UlalaMolly Annoyed: And I'm only 21!

OniSilver Angry: Our age is of no relevence! **[gets in his battle stance]** Show your face, fearsome foe.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: **Kyehehehehe!!** Foolish humans! You cannot stand up to the might of me and my minions.

WitchArrietty: Sure, we can. And we can also kick your ass no problem, either.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Kyeh? A bunch of cocky kids thinking they can take on an entire castle of traps and all sorts of horrors? Pah! Heard it all before! You all shall be my tonight's meal. Kyehehehehe...

WitchArrietty Smug: Pfft, please. That's nothing.

UlalaMolly Happy: We're the Cyborg Resistance after all!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Cyber Resistance?! Oh! Ohhhh!! I've heard of you. My master would be most pleased if I've captured you all! But before I go on...

%Suddenly, the whole room is surrounded in a purple mist, blinding the three and causing them to have a coughing fit. Soon after, the mist fades away into nothing and the room's visibility is cleared up.

UlalaMolly Shocked: Uh, what was that all about?!

WitchArrietty Happy: Doesn't matter! **[strikes a pose]** Let's show those evil-doers...

OniSilver Happy: **[also striking a pose]** that they shall fear the might of...

UlalaMolly Happy: **[strikes a pose too]** the Cyborg Resistance!!

%...

WitchArrietty Shocked: How come nothing is happening?

UlalaMolly Shocked: It's not usually this slow... right?

OniSilver Nani: Seems our electronics have been jammed!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Kyehehe, that's right! That purple mist disabled all your cybernetic abilities! Let's see you Cyber Twerps talk all high and mighty now!

OniSilver Angry: Handicapping our abilities? You are dishonorable and a coward!

WitchArrietty: Powers or no powers, we're going to kick your butt, whoever you are!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: We'll see about that when you're all in such a vunerable state! Even if you manage through my minions and face me, you're still no match of me! Either way, I will have my feast! **Kyehehehehe!!!**

UlalaMolly Sad: N-Now what do we do?

OniSilver Angry: We power through the castle with the best of our normal abilities.

WitchArrietty Happy: Right. He's not going to take us down!

%The three nod and head off to the hallway ahead of them, starting their haunted journey through the castle.

%End of Act 1

@ACTNUM: ACT 2

@LOCATIONcastle: OLD CASTLE

%Minutes has past; Molly, Arrietty, and Silver soon see themselves wandering the dingy halls of the creepy castle.

UlalaMolly Sad: M-maybe we should just leave...?

WitchArrietty Annoyed: Don't you remember? The door's broken, and all the ground level windows are sealed!

OniSilver: And because our electronics are jammed, we can't break out of here or call for help.

WitchArrietty Sad: We may as well try to fight our way out of here, since it is our only option.

UlalaMolly Sad: Oh, right. O-okay then...

%A few minutes pass, until suddenly...

WitchArrietty Shocked: Hey, I think I hear something!

%Suddenly, out of a rickety old door, bursts a zombie!

AstroZombieg: Ggggrrrrrreeehhhhh!!

UlalaMolly Shocked: Eek! An Astro Zombieg!!

WitchArrietty Angry: Seriously, a zombie? How cliche!

OniSilver Angry: Cliche or not, be on your guard! And don't let it bite you!

%The Astro Zombieg starts shambling towards the three, backing them into a corner!

WitchArrietty Shocked: Oh no! We're cornered!!

AstroZombieg: Mmmmgggrrreeehhhhhh...

UlalaMolly Shocked: A-any ideas on how we deal with this creep?

OniSilver Shocked: I'm still working on that part of the plan!

%The Astro Zombieg continues to corner them!

AstroZombieg: Braaaaaaiiiiiinssss

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Wait a moment, you're a robot! Why do you want to eat brains? I don't think the ol' grey matter is a particularly efficient fuel for robots.

AstroZombieg: ...

UlalaMolly: ...

AstroZombieg: Look, I'm a zombie, it's all part of the image, y'know?

UlalaMolly: Oh, ok, carry on then.

AstroZombieg: Brrraaaiiii-

UlalaMolly Annoyed: **[interrupting]** *ACTUALLY* wait a sec, doesn't "eating the brains out of humans" also severely violate the laws of robotics?

AstroZombieg: ...

UlalaMolly: ...

AstroZombieg: You suck the fun out of everything, don't you?

WitchArrietty: Hey, just curious... How long is a robot zombie life anyways?

AstroZombieg: ...

WitchArrietty: ...

AstroZombieg: ...

WitchArrietty: ...

AstroZombieg: Ugeeehhhh? **[suddenly collapses]**

EVERYBODY: ...

WitchArrietty Happy: Not long enough apparently!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: KYEHH? You've already defeated my army of zombies???

OniSilver Annoyed: We have done absolutely nothing.

WitchArrietty Smug: Except stalling its inevitable demise.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: And army?!? More like a wimp! That was pathetic, mysterious creepy voice!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Kyeh! There was just one?! There were suppose to be a bunch of them! Where are they!?

%MEANWHILE...

AstroZombiegs: **[Has a bag of party supplies Arrietty has left in the graveyard, they all party til they break apart]**

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: No matter! The next room will provide a much tougher challenge!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: **KYEH HEH HEH!!!!**

WitchArrietty Annoyed: His laughter is really getting on my nerves.

UlalaMolly Angry: Yeah, it's annoying! Learn another evil laugh! 

UlalaMolly Sad: N-not that I want to hear any c-creepy laughs...

OniSilver Annoyed: Let's just press on to the next room.

%After a few minutes of aimless wandering, the group finds a seemingly empty room.

WitchArrietty: An empty room...?

OniSilver: This room might not be as empty as you think, look!

%He points up to the ceiling of the room, where a black orb is dangling down.

OniSilver: What do you think that could be?

WitchArrietty: An evil disco ball??

%The black orb unravels itself, revealing itself to be...

UlalaMolly Happy: A Batton! And if my intuition is correct, it's specifically the Batton M48 model!

WitchArrietty: How can you tell? They don't seem to be all that different to me.

BattonM48: **[flies around menacingly]**

UlalaMolly Happy: Awwwww, isn't it cuuuuuute? 

BattonM48: **[lands on Molly's arm]**

WitchArrietty Shocked: Are you sure you should let it do that?

UlalaMolly: Can we keep him?

OniSilver Annoyed: I don't think that's a good idea...

%**CHOMP!**

UlalaMolly Shocked: ***OUCH!***

BattonM48: **[has its tiny teeth sunk into Molly's arm]**

UlalaMolly Angry: IT BIT ME! **[throws the Batton M48 out of an expensive looking stained glass window in retaliation]**

Mysterious Voice: KYAAAAHHH! You know how much I paid to get that window made?!?

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Looked pretty cheap to me.

OniSilver: Which is strange... You would think such a building wouldn't cheap out on stained glass windows of all things.

WitchArrietty: Sounds like a cheapskate owner if you ask me.

Mysterious Voice: I resent that!

%Before the trio can continue, the door bursts open and a robotic knight speeds in!

GilliamKnight: Greetings. I must apologize for my lateness. I do hope thee can forgive me.

WitchArrietty Happy: You're forgiven.

GilliamKnight: While I hold nothing against thee, my master has decreed that I try my best to slay thee.

OniSilver: You seem like a true gentleman. Shall we have a duel?

GilliamKnight: That sounds like a perfect idea! Stand back, fair maidens!

WitchArrietty Angry: "Fair maidens?"

%Silver and the knight both begin to engage in a duel. It appears that the two are evenly matched. Molly and Arrietty watch intently, rooting for Silver.

UlalaMolly Shocked: W-wait a sec! I think I recognize this robot... it's a Gilliam Knight! Be extra super careful, Dimey!!

%As clouds part in the sky, the full moon shines down into the room.

GilliamKnight: **[stands back a bit and drops his lance in dispair]**

OniSilver Nani: Hm?!

%The Gilliam Knight immediately stops dueling, as he goes stiff and starts to tremble. Two wolf legs burst out from either side of his lower body, while a wolf head pops out between the new legs!

WitchArrietty Angry: Ewwww, gross!

UlalaMolly Shocked: Ughhh, put that thing away!

OniSilver Annoyed: I must admit, that does look a tad unsavory.

%The Gilliam Knight bends over backwards as his arms and head become the wolf's hind legs and tail.

GilliamKnightWolf: **[snarls, and lunges toward Silver!]**

OniSilver: **[is fighting back against the attacking wolf]** Ughhh! Begone.... foul beast!!

UlalaMolly Shocked: Dimey!!!

%At the sound of Molly's voice, the transformed Gilliam Knight turns its attention towards her instead.

UlalaMolly Shocked: Oh no no no, stay back!

%The wolf lunges at Molly instead, pinning her down on the ground!

UlalaMolly Shocked: Eeek!!! I'm trapped!

GilliamKnightWolf: **[snarls]**

%Free from the attacker, Silver looks around the room, and sees a bulky suit of armor. In its grasp, is a long pointy spear. He pulls the spear out of the armor's grasp. Suddenly the helmet of said armor comes to life for a brief moment.

Ragger: Hey, please remember to give that back once you're finished with it!

OniSilver: Noted my friend.

%Silver holds the spear at the ready as he inches carefully towards the transformed Gilliam Knight.

OniSilver Angry: Now I say this again. BEGONE, foul beast!!! **[stabs the wolf through the midsection with the spear!]**

GilliamKnightWolf: **[howls in pain, before falling to the side]**

%With the Gilliam Knight defeated, Molly gets back up and brushes herself off as Silver Dime returns the lance to the helmet friend.

Ragger: Thank you. **[the helmet shuts it eyes, appearing as just a knight display again]**

UlalaMolly Shocked: **[in thought]** Was that a Ragger...?

UlalaMolly Shocked: An-anyways, th-that encounter was absolutely TERRIFYING!!

OniSilver Angry: Why didn't you warn me about that before?

UlalaMolly Annoyed: I didn't have the time!

UlalaMolly: Let's regroup and...

%Silver and Molly look around the room.

UlalaMolly Shocked: Wait... w-where did Arri go...?

OniSilver: I'm not sure...

%End of Act 2

@ACTNUM: ACT 3

@LOCATIONcastle: MYSTERIOUS CASTLE

%An hour has now passed, after facing hoardes of monsters in the search for Arrietty with no luck. Eventually, the two face yet another door.

OniSilver: **[peeks inside the room]** This room appears to be empty...

%The two of them quickly dart into the room.

UlalaMolly Happy: Ahhhh, finally! A break from all the monsters!

OniSilver: Now that we are safe for a while we must relax for a bit, recollect our minds and figure out how to find and rescue Arrietty.

UlalaMolly Sad: I really hope she is doing okay...

OniSilver: By the way, doesn't something about this castle bother you?

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Yeeeeah... about that, I've had this strange feeling that it's not as old as it is apparently seeming to be...

OniSilver: Mmhmm. That I've also gathered from my observation.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: These walls... the material they're made of. It may *look* the part of an old stone castle, but it's actually made of much cheaper and more "modern" materials!

UlalaMolly Annoyed: And the robots we've been battling... Astro Zombieg, Ragger, Cyorown, Batton M48, Gilliam Knight... I know these models! These robots were created for an old amusement park's haunted house!

OniSilver: So this isn't a real castle in any way?

UlalaMolly: Far from it! And this specific selection of robots reminds me of someone in particular... The one behind all this is...

UlalaMolly Angry: DWN-055!!

OniSilver Annoyed: ...

UlalaMolly: Shade Man!

OniSilver Shocked: Oh!

UlalaMolly Angry: And if it's Shade Man behind all this....

OniSilver Angry: ... then that "master" he's been mentioning is likely Dr. Wily!

UlalaMolly Angry: This is bad! We got to save Arrietty as soon as possible!

%All of a sudden, the PSA speakers in the room turns on.

ShadeMan: **[over the PSA]** Well done, you've figured it out!

UlalaMolly Angry: Shade Man!

ShadeMan: It is I who has sent this army of robots against you, and it is I who rules over this castle! But I do believe, there is one of my most powerful minions who you have yet to meet!

UlalaMolly: It must be...

%Before Molly can finish, a gigantic jack o' lantern crashes through the ceiling, into the room!

OniSilver: What's this? A giant pumpkin? This certainly shouldn't put up much of a fight!

UlalaMolly: Not just any pumpkin, it's a Van Pookin!

%As soon as Molly says that, the thrusters on the bottom of the large robot come to life, lifting it into the air!

UlalaMolly Shocked: Eek! It's gonna crush us!!

VanPookin: **[starts to fire small bouncing projectiles that explode brightly after several seconds]**

UlalaMolly Shocked: Ack! What's going on???

OniSilver Angry: It appears this oversized gourd has quite the explosive abilities. Watch out!

%The multiple bright flashes from the explosions disorient the duo!

UlalaMolly Shocked: Oh no!! I can't see!

%In the confusion, Silver accidentally backs into a trick bookcase, which spins around, trapping him behind the wall!

UlalaMolly: Wait a sec, I have an idea....

VanPookin: **[starts to open up, revealing two smaller pumpkins, in order to deliver its final attack]**

%Molly quickly picks up one of the bouncy explosives

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Now.... eat THIS!

%Molly throws the explosive right into the mouth of the smallest pumpkin. it quickly explodes, causing Van Pookin to break apart and fall down with a huge crash

UlalaMolly Happy: Ha! That Van Pookin really was a dim bulb, right Dimey?

%...

UlalaMolly Shocked: ... Uhhhh, Dimey? Helloooooooooo?

%There is no response. Molly is completely alone.

UlalaMolly Sad: **[thinking]** Okay, Dimey's gone. Arri's gone. You're on your own in a haunted castle. No time to panic...

%Molly takes a deep breath and tries to focus on the situation at hand.

UlalaMolly Sad: T-that,s right, I-I can't lose my mind here. My friends need me. I-I must find out where Dimey could have possible gone. This room isn't too big, so there should be a clue...

%She examines around the place until she comes across a wall that looks a tad out of place.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Hmm. Wasn't there a bookshelf there? So it must be a...

%As soon as she places her hand on the wall, it rotates with the wall pushing her into the room behind it, restoring the bookshelf's origin placement.

UlalaMolly Shocked: **[fallen on the ground]** A rotating bookshelf! **[she gets herself up and looks at the stairway ahead of her, noticing big footprints followed with footprints of someone being dragged]**

UlalaMolly Angry: Dimey must've been immediately attacked as soon as he got here. Shade Man or a minion of his must've been waiting for this trap to trigger. Going by the two set of footprints, he has definitely been kidnapped!

UlalaMolly Shocked: And up ahead is the staircase... This likely leads to Shade Man's lair.

%Molly takes another deep breath and begins walking forward cautiously.

UlalaMolly Sad: Okay, Molly. You can do this. This is the final confrontation... You've gotten this far. Nothing can stop you now...

%Molly finally reaches the end of the stairway and sees the villainous vampire sitting on their throne, drinking from what it appears to be blood in a wine glass.

UlalaMolly Sad: **[gasp]** I-is that blood?! Augh! I hope my friends are really okay. I have to act as soon as possible because their lives depend on me! W-what would Arrietty do if she was in my position...?

UlalaMolly Annoyed: ...

%Molly rushes into the room and immediately points at the vampire, holding a plastic whip.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Die Monster! You don't belong in this world!

UlalaMolly Shocked: (Whoops! Definitely not that!)

ShadeMan: **[amused]** It was not by *my* hand that I'm once again given flesh. I was called here by *humans* who wish to pay me tribute.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: (...roll with it.)

UlalaMolly: "Tribute"?! You steal men's souls, and make them your slaves!

ShadeMan: What is a man?! **[gets hit in the face with a whip, he drops his wine and it shatters on the floor spilling tomato juice everywhere]** Ow!

UlalaMolly Angry: No, no, no! You did it wrong and got too ahead of the script, let's start over!

ShadeMan Annoyed: Fine, let's- 

ShadeMan Shocked: Wait! MY TOMATO JUICE! NO! **[looks around frantically, then starts licking the tomato juice off the floor]**

UlalaMolly Annoyed: **[disgusted look]** ...I'm just glad it isn't really blood after all.

ShadeMan Annoyed: Look at what you've done! That was my last glass! Grrr... You little brat. Kyeh... I'll...

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Should've memorized the script!

ShadeMan Scary: Enough! **[eyes glows red as he lunges towards Molly]** Have at you!

UlalaMolly Shocked: You did it wrong aga- **EEK!!**

%CHOMP!!

UlalaMolly Shocked: ...

ShadeMan Scary: ...

ShadeMan Shocked: ***KYEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH?!?!!*** *GARLIC?! AUGHHHHH* **[stumbles a bit away from Molly]** *MY ENTIRE TEETH SUNK INTO GARLIC. WHY?! WHY DID WILY PROGRAM THIS WEAKNESS?! AUGH BLEHCK.*

UlalaMolly Smug: Ha! I knew even robot vampires would be weak to my garlic shield!

ShadeMan Annoyed: **[gagging hard]** You little brat! How did you even get that?! And *why* is it a shield, of all things?! Where did you even get it from anyways?!

UlalaMolly Smug: My backpack, where all of my other "monster repelents" are stored in!

WitchArrietty Angry: **[is in a cage that is hanging from the cieling]** Huh? The entire time, I just thought it was just a costume prop.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Ulala doesn't wear a backpack, Arri!

UlalaMolly Shocked: Wait! Arri?! You're alive!?

UlalaMolly Happy: *YOU'RE ALIVE!!*

OniSilver: **[also in a cage]** That we are. Seems we have underestimated our foe, our apologies.

UlalaMolly Happy: Fortunately, I've brought just about *every* monster weakness I can think of just for our safety! **[she pulls down the lever on the wall, bringing the cages down and frees the two]**

OniSilver Happy: You've thought of everything I see.

UlalaMolly: I'm just glad my fear of monsters paid off.

ShadeMan Annoyed: **[mostly recovered]** Kyeh... Your decision to make a fool out of me is your ultimate demise, brat.

WitchArrietty Smug: It's three against one now, Shade Man. You're finished!

OniSilver: I would not assume with such haste, our state still leaves us very vunerable.

ShadeMan: **Kyeh Heh Heh!!** My spell renders you all hopeless against me. And now I'm done messing with you brats. **[an eerie aura slowly forms around him]**

WitchArrietty Shocked: Molly, do you have anything else?!

UlalaMolly Shocked: **[frantically going through the backpack]** There gotta be another garlic, which pocket did I put it in!?

ShadeMan Scary: I shall end all of your foolish mortal lives right now! **[his wings expands and his eyes glows red once again as the red glowy aura intensifies]**

UlalaMolly Shocked: I have nothing else that could work!

WitchArrietty Shocked: Nothing?!

%The entire castle around Shade Man begins to quake due to ever growing intense aura.

OniSilver Angry: Brace yourselves for the worst. **[gets in a guarding stance]**

ShadeMan Scary: Farewell, mortals! See you all in *HELL*! **KYAAAAAAAHHHHH HAAAAA-

ShadeMan Shocked: **AGUHHHHKCK!!?!?** 

%Shade Man's aura suddenly gets cut short, then suddenly and inexplicably he falls to the ground, completely battered.

OniSilver Shocked: ...

WitchArrietty Annoyed: ...What just happened?

UlalaMolly Shocked: Wasn't me. I had nothing else that would work in the bag!

OniSilver: Not I either!

%A white glowly spring behind where Shade Man was bounces up and down while approaching towards the three.

ShadeMan Damaged: Gah... s-springs. My one true weakness...

UlalaMolly Shocked: U-um... A-A ghost spring?

%The spring morphs into into a menancing ghostly figure.

UlalaMolly Shocked: **A-AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! A-A REAL**

WitchArrietty: **[hops excitedly]** Ghost!?

ShadeMan Shocked: WAUGHHHHH!?!?! **[hops off the ground and does a cartoonish run cycle while suspended in mid-air]** I'm out of here!!

%Shade Man zooms right through the window and falls straight down, forgetting to fly.

SFX: **CRASH!!**

WitchArrietty Happy: I can't believe it, Molly! Ghosts really do exist! **[approaches slowly towards it]**

OniSilver Angry: Stand back, Arrietty! **[glares right at the ghostly figure]** Identify yourself.

SpookyGhost: Repent...

UlalaMolly Shocked: **[visibly shakened]** R-Repent...?!

SpookyGhost: **[points at the three]** You all shall repent for your grave misdeed...

WitchArrietty Shocked: Oh no! We've angered the spirits of the graveyard!

UlalaMolly Shocked: B-but i-isn't this just an abandoned amusement park...?!

SpookyGhost: Your misdeed... was...

%Immediately, the ghost stops glowing right before transforming quickly into a familiar face.

Fake Angry: Making us wait outside for the past 2 hours!

UlalaMolly Shocked: **[faints]**

WitchArrietty Sad: What? It's just Fakette?! Aww...

Fake Snicker: Ahahahaha!! You all should've seen the look on your faces!

OniSilver Angry: That wasn't funny.

WitchArrietty Sad: Yeah, I thought we found a real ghost...

OniSilver Annoyed: ...

Fake: But seriously! When's the party starting? And who was that vampire-looking guy that ran by? Is he a friend of yours? Were you all partying without us?!

OniSilver Happy: No, the party has just started.

WitchArrietty Happy: Yeah! It's one heck of a spooky place, right Molly?

WitchArrietty: ...Molly?

Fake Snicker: **[giggles at the fainted girl]** Hehe, well that's what we call a halloween scare!

WitchArrietty Shocked: Oh hey, not that we need to transform anytime soon, but I can feel the curse being lifted off of us.

OniSilver Happy: You're right! And the whole team is waiting for us, let's group up with them and finally begin our party.

WitchArrietty Shocked: Hmmm... Oh! I forgot that I've somehow left all the party supplies on the graveyard! Hopefully nothing happened to it.

UlalaMolly Sad: **[slowly waking up]** Huhhh...? **[looks around and sees the three heading down the stairway]**

UlalaMolly Shocked: H-Hey wait for me! **[runs and catches up with them]**

%Eventually, Arrietty, Molly and Silver Dime told the team all about their crazy adventures and soon after they had their party.
