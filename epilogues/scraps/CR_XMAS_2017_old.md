ACT I
</h1></center></div>

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>Living Room</div>

Narrator: It's the night of Christmas Eve... Eve Eve Eve! Which means 4 days before Christmas. Wow! Anyways, just your-**[BOOM]** ...typical day... Yeah.

SplashShocked: [rushing to the living room] What the heck? What just happened??

SpikeAloof: ...

GalaxyDamaged: [blackened and dizzy from the impact] Uhhh.... ummm... [falls over]

PlugShocked: **Great scott!!** [points towards the Christmas tree] The tree is on fire! Put it out!!

Jewel: [attempts to spray with the fire extinguisher] I can't! There's nothing in it?!

SplashAnnoyed: Dang it! It's been used up for some reason, why?

PlugScared: I don't know, but do something!! The fire is about to spread to the ground!

FakeSnicker: Not to worry! Fakette and her shapeshifting powers to the rescue!

<div class="narration">
Fakette transforms into a huge floating ice bucket of water. She then throws the ice cold water towards the fire right before turning herself back to normal.
</div>

FakeHappy: *Tada~!* All done!

Splash: Uh... Where did the water come from?

FakeSad: My blood...... [immediately collaspes]

SplashShocked: **!?**

FakeSnicker: Just kidding! It's really just water.

SplashAnnoyed: ...

SplashAngry: *Right*... Anyways, who have commited such a terrible act? Who would burn the tree?!

GalaxyShocked: It wasn't me!

HornetGlare: A likely story.

<div class="narration">
*AHEM*
</div>

Tornado: Tornde will solve unknown cause.

Splash: Always good to have our resident detective!

GalaxyShocked: ...

Tornado: [walks over to the burnt tree and inspects it] Cause not regular. Top burnt from extreme. Robot Master power possible. [turns back to the team]

GalaxyShocked: **!!**

TornadoAnnoyed: Yes. Reaction. Power was likely space man. [points at Galaxy Man's direction]

JewelAnnoyed: Galaxy Man?! Ugh! I've told you creating a mini nova star would-

SplashAngry: What?! Seriously?! Why on Earth would you create a mini nova.

GalaxySad: I just wanted to make a fancy star for the tree...

HornetAngry: [grabs Galaxy Man] **YOU MORON. DO YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THAT IS? SURE THAT WOULD BURNED DOWN THE WHOLE DAMNED HOUSE, BUT THIS MEANS I CAN'T SLEEP ANYMORE. I NEED MY PRECIOUS HOURS OF SLEEP.**

SplashAnnoyed: Uhm...

SpikeAloof: ...

GalaxyShocked: Wait! I'm sorry! Sorry! It won't happen again! Don't hurt meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

HornetGlare: Meh. 

<div class="narration">
Hornet looks at the charred tree then chucks Galaxy Man towards it.
</div>

HornetGlare: Feh. Now that's taken care of I'm going back to sleep.

SplashAnnoyed: But it's only 5PM.

HornetAnnoyed: Yeah so? I just want to sleep til the Holiday goes by.

FakeAnnoyed: Well, I see someone's not in the holiday spirit.

Hornet: I get nothing but coal every Christmas. What good is coal these days?! USELESS GARBAGE! THAT'S WHAT!

GalaxyDamaged: Well maybe if you weren't such a...

HornetGlare: ...

GalaxyDamaged: Uhm...

HornetGlare: Finish that. I dare you.

SplashAngry: He's right though. Maybe you at least should spend the rest of the holidays being nice!

Hornet: And?
 
Splash: So that way you won't end up on Santa's naughty list?

Hornet: Santa's not real!

Splash: Yes he is!

Hornet: I'm not stupid, Splash Man.

Jewel: He wasn't going to fall for that you know.

SplashAnnoyed: *Sigh*

Plug: [cleaning up the mess from the fire] I think we need a new a new tree...

HornetAnnoyed: [shakes his head] Bah Humbug...

SplashAngry: Oh don't you start that-

HornetGlare: Bah Humbug!!

JewelAnnoyed: Jeez, don't be such a Scrooge!

HornetAngry: **BAH HUMBUG!**

<div class="narration">
Hornet leaves to his room and slams the door shut.
</div>

SplashAnnoyed: This is going to be a long night...

Fake: [to self] ...Should we? Hmmm...

SplashAnnoyed: What? Give him more presents full of coal?

FakeAnnoyed: Well no. Jewel's comment gave me an idea actually!

PlugHappy: Oh! Do tell!

FakeAnnoyed: Why don't we dress up as the three Ghosts of Christmas and teach him the holiday spirit?

Splash: That's never going to work. He'll just end up being annoyed!

FakeSnicker: Exactly!

SplashAnnoyed: ...

PlugAnnoyed: ...

SplashHappy: I'm in!

Plug: Same I guess.

GalaxyRelieved: Oh! Me too! Me too!

FakeSnicker: Great! So that's the four of us. This is going to be *so fun*.

ACT II
</h1></center></div>

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>Living Room</div>

<div class="narration">
Magma Man appears into the scene by sliding down the stairway's rails and with his feet and does a double flip jump at the end of the rail then lands perfectly onto the living room floor.
</div>

TornadoHappy: [holds up a "10" card]

JewelHappy: [holds up a "10" card as well]

SpikeAloof: [holds up a blank card] ...

MagmaAnnoyed: Oh come on! You're even too lazy to write a number, Concrete?! Where is your Sinimas Spirit?

Jewel: What's a Sinimas?

MagmaHappy: Only the best holiday ever conceived in Sinistar-kind!

TornadoAnnoyed: What?

MagmaAnnoyed: Don't tell me you've never heard of Sinimas!

TornadoAnnoyed: Confusion. We want Sinimas knowledge to be acquired.

MagmaHappy: It's a wonderful time where all the Sinistars come together and celebrate a festive day by eating space ships!

Jewel: ...

TornadoAnnoyed: ...

MagmaAnnoyed: What?

Jewel: For starters, there's several holidays this month and I'm certain Sinimas is not one of them!

MagmaHappy: Well, there should be if there isn't one on this planet! It's time to change things up. Sinimas isn't going to start itself! To the North Pole!

JewelShocked: North Pole?!

MagmaGiddy: That's right! I'm going to replace Christmas. What better way to introduce the world to Sinimas than replacing one of the biggest holidays of the country?! Ol' St. Nicholas is gonna have a brand new PR for his holiday brand! Me!

JewelAnnoyed: Um, have fun with that I guess.

MagmaGiddy: YEAHHHH!!!

<div class="narration">
Magma Man dashes outside, gets in a flying vehicle and flies away.
</div>

TornadoAnnoyed: Still confusion. But also concern.

JewelAnnoyed: Wait, did he just took Dr. Light's flying car?

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>Hornet Man's Bedroom</div>

HornetSleep: Zzzz... Zzzzzzzzz........

GhostPast: Heheheh...

GhostPast: BOO!

HornetShocked: [immediately wakes up and sits up on his bed] AUGH! What the?! [turns to the ghost] ...

HornetGlare: Who the hell are you?

GhostPast: Hornet Mannnnnnnn... I am the Ghost of your Christmas Pastttttt...

Hornet: ...

HornetGlare: So?

GhostPast: We are here for your misdeeds and poor character... We the three ghosts have come with a warninggg...

HornetGlare: Really? Then where's the other ghosts?

GhostPast: They will arrive laterrrr, one by oneeee....

HornetAnnoyed: Do you think I actually care?

GhostPast: No.

HornetGlare: Then stop bugging me. You're just an annoying candle, so just go away before I'll show you a misdeed. And cut it out with your ghostly act, dumbass.

GhostPastAnnoyed: But wouldn't you at least like to revisit your past? It's right out of this door!

HornetAnnoyed: You know what? Fine.

GhostPast: Follow me! [bumps into the door] Ooof! Uh, can you open the door? I have no hands...

<div class="narration">
Hornet Man gets out of the bed and walks towards the door to open it. As he enters the living room, he sees it decorated with props and decorations while resembling an living room from many decades ago despite his young age. He then sees Splash Man who is just wearing a shoddy outfit representing Hornet Man from the past.
</div>

HornetGlare: Wait a minute... [looks at young Hornet Man's lack of legs] Where are my legs?

PastHornet: ...

GhostPastAnnoyed: Because bees aren't born with legs!

Hornet: [turns to the ghost] Uhh, yeah they do!

GhostPast: No they don't! Ever heard of evolution?! You'll grow them later! [gives a hand signal to Plug Man secretly]

HornetGlare: That's not how evolution works.

PlugAnnoyed: [tip toes in and tapes fake cardboard cutout of a pair of regular human legs onto Splash Man's tail and tip toes out of the scene]

GhostPast: Yes it does! The proof is right there! Look!

PastHornetAnnoyed: [suddenly wearing the cardboard cutout of legs] I've just evolved. Wow.

GhostPast: Convinced now?

HornetGlare: ...

HornetAnnoyed: Yes, I guess if you've been changing history by messing with time and space.

GhostPast: No one can see or hear us, though! It's not real time travel, we're just in your subconcious! So you're only experiencing old memories.

HornetGlare: What?! Ugh! I wanna go back to my room then. No point if I can't change history myself!

GhostPastAnnoyed: I've just told you we're here to show your misdeeds. Not to change the past! That's the whole point!

Hornet: Wow, me being silent and doing absolutely nothing. The true sins of my past!

GhostPastAnnoyed: [glares at Splash Man]

PastHornet: !

PastHornetAnnoyed: My name is Hornet Man and I smell really bad!

HornetGlare: ...Hmmm...

GhostPastAnnoyed: ...

GalaxyAnnoyed: [behind a prop] **ahem**

PastHornetAnnoyed: Oh! Ha ha ha My name is Hornet Man and I am 5 years old and I am mean!! [lazily smashes a bunch of empty xmas boxes]

GhostPast: So... uh... Do you get it now?

Hornet: Yeah, I just need to take care of my personal hygene more.

GhostPastAnnoyed: Erm...

Hornet: Look, I honestly don't know what else is wrong here.

GhostPastAnnoyed: Really? Nothing else wrong your past self?

HornetGlare: Yes and you're just wasting my time at this point. So just go away and tell your ghostly idiots to not bother!

<div class="narration">
Hornet Man walks back to his room and rests in his bed again.
</div>

GalaxyAnnoyed: I honestly can't tell if our goal is to annoy him or actually help him...

FakeSnicker: [poof] Well I gotta pretend to care and be in character! Plus he seemed pretty annoyed there, so we're accomplishing what we wanted most!

PastHornet: I don't know, if anything, I feel I'm the unfortunate one.

FakeSnicker: Well you've agreed to this farce!

PastHornet: But I didn't agree to wear *this*!

PlugAnnoyed: [gets out of the big fake present box] I guess it's my turn...

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>Somewhere in a snowy land...</div>

MagmaAnnoyed: [walking through the barren landscape] Curses! First the engine froze causing my vehicle to crash and now 50 miles in I'm still seeing no sight of the workshop!

MagmaGiddy: Well, least it's not cold enough to freeze my ever so burning body! Ha! And I am certain the workshop is still not too far from here!!

Chill: Hey, man. 

MagmaAnnoyed: Eh? Who may you be?

Chill: Just a forgotten member of an old defunct team... Never recognized and always missing in action.

MagmaSad: Oh...

Chill: Haha, nah. I don't care. I was so lazy and was never there for them. Anyways, welcome to the South Pole. Population: Me

MagmaShocked: South Pole?! I thought this was the North Pole!

Chill: Nope. You must've took the wrong turn and ended up here.

MagmaAnnoyed: Darn it!! Who knew piloting in reverse would be such a terrible idea?

Chill: Hey, just chill... man. Haha!

MagmaHappy: Hahaha! Good pun! High five!!

<div class="narration">
Magma Man and Chill Man gives each other a five high. Right before their hands hit, Chill Man suddenly fades away...
</div>

MagmaShocked: Woah?!

MagmaAnnoyed: [looks around] Man... Being stranded in such a frozen desert is really starting to get into me!

Magma: And if what my imaginary friend just said is true... how am I going to get out of this mess... Hmmm...

Hornet: Just dig to the other side, ya dumbass.

MagmaHappy: You're right, mirage Hornet Man! Always a genius!

MagmaGiddy: Oh man, this would create an awesome entrance. Surely Santa would hire such a cool guy such as ME!

<div class="narration">
He takes out a huge drill and goes drilling in from the center of the South Pole.

<h1>ACT III</h1>
</center></div>

MagmaAngry: **RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!**

<div class="narration">
Magma Man shouts loudly as he digs through planet from the very bottom towards the top. Eventually he meets the center of the planet; its core.
</div>

MagmaAngry: **RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!** [gets engulfed in the molten magma of the core]

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>The North Pole</div>

SantaSad: Ho ho ho...

Elf: What's wrong, Santa?

SantaSad: Christmas just isn't the same anymore, Jimmy... Just not the same...

Elf: But we do the same thing every year?

Santa: Exactly! And how long have we've been doing it? For centuries! We need something new... something... fresh. Something that would make it exciting for me again!

Elf: Like what?

SantaThinking: [sighs and sits back on his rocking chair] Like... Hmm...

<div class="narration">
Suddenly, the North Pole begins to shake as if there's an earthquake!
</div>

ElfShocked: WH-WHAT THE?!

SantaShocked: An earthquake?! Here?! In the North Pole?!

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>Hornet Man's Bedroom</div>

HornetSleep: ZZzzz... 

GhostPresent: ...

HornetSleep: ZzzzZZzz...

GhostPresentAnnoyed: ...

HornetSleep: ZzZzzzZzz... ZzzzZZzz...

GhostPresentScared: ...

HornetSleep: ZZzzzZzZZzz...zzzzZzz... ZzZzzz... ZzzzzZZZzzzzz........

HornetPissed: [immediately gets up] **AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!**

GhostPresentShocked: **AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!**

HornetSleep: [immediately goes back to sleep] Zzzzzzz...

GhostPresentAngry: HEY! [kicks the bed] Get up!!

HornetGlare: Zzzz... huh? What?

Hornet: ...

GhostPresentScared: ...

Hornet: Oh, I must be still dreaming about ghosts...

GhostPresentAngry: You're not! We're real and I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present!

HornetAnnoyed: Oh, damn it.

GhostPresentAnnoyed: Anyways...!! Uhh... You're in the present now.

Hornet: ...

GhostPresentHappy: ...

HornetGlare: And?

GhostPresentScared: We're just really standing here. And that is what's going on in the present. Now I've hope you've learned your valuable lesson and become an upstanding citizen!

HornetAngry: The only valuable lesson I've learned is that you're an insufferable idiot prick. GET LOST!

GhostPresentShocked: EEP!! W-well... uh...! Bye!

<div class="narration">
GhostPresent Man dashes out of the room.
</div>

Hornet: [deep sigh and rests]

SplashAnnoyed: ...

GhostPresent: S-sorry, mon ami. I couldn't do it! He was just too immitating to handle...

FakeAnnoyed: Why couldn't you let Galaxy Man handle that one?

GalaxyHappy: Oh! Don't worry, I've got a great idea as the next ghost!

GhostPresentHappy: Oh! Do tell!

Galaxy: Well, we can't let the readers know! [faces to the reader] Why don't you tune in to the other scene first?

FakeShocked: Readers??

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>The North Pole</div>

SantaShocked: What in god's name is an earthquake doing around here?!

ElfShocked: What is that screaming?!

MagmaAngry: **RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!**

<div class="narration">
Magma Man finally reaches to the surface of the North Pole. He pops out of the hole he just created several yards away from Santa's Workshop as a lava geyser spews out of the hole. As soon as he lands, he strikes a pose!
</div>

SantaShocked: HO HO HOLY SHIT!!

Elf: [holds up a "10" card]

Santa: [holds up a "11" card]

SpikeAloof: [holds up a blank card] ...

MagmaAnnoyed: ...[shoots his magma bazooka at Concrete Man]

SpikeAloof: [blows up]

MagmaGiddy: SANTAAAAA!!

SantaHappy: BILLY!!!!

MagmaAngry: My name is not Billy!!!

SantaSad: Sorry

MagmaHappy: Anyways, ol' Nick! I've came literally all the way from the other side of the planet to ask for a certain job position.

Santa: A job position?

Magma: Yeah, like a PR!

SantaThinking: Hmmm... Well, we don't have any job listings for a PR.

MagmaSad: Aw...

Santa: However! I think there are changes needed are in order... You can only do so much with doing the same thing after so many centuries, after all...

Magma: Oh?

SantaSad: Yeah! In fact... Christmas is hardly my holiday anymore. It used to be all about giving the gifts of joy to children and family everywhere...

SantaAngry: But now it's just an excuse for the commercialized industry to make 20x more money! I hardly get to make my own gifts to children anymore. We've gotta reclaim what was rightfully mine!

MagmaGiddy: [fist pump] Yeah! LET'S RECLAIM IT AND RENAME IT TO SINIMAS!

SantaShocked: Sinimas?!

MagmaHappy: Ya.

SantaThinking: Sounds threatening... They would have a hard time taking our holiday away from us again! I'll allow it!

ElfShocked: Are you sure you really want to do this?!

MagmaGiddy: HECK YEA!!

Santa: I don't see why not.

MagmaAngry: BEWARE COWARDS. WE ARE SINIMAS.
