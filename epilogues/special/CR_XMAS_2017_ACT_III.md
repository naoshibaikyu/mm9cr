@ACTNUM: ACT III

MagmaAngry: **RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!**

%Magma Man shouts loudly as he digs through planet from the very bottom towards the top. Eventually he meets the center of the planet; its core.

MagmaAngry: **RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!** *[gets engulfed in the molten magma of the core]*

@LOCATION: The North Pole

SantaSad: Ho ho ho...

Elf: What's wrong, Santa?

SantaSad: Christmas just isn't the same anymore, Jimmy... Just not the same...

Elf: But don't we do the same thing every year?

Santa: Exactly! And how long have we've been doing it? For centuries! We need something new... something... fresh. Something that would make it exciting for me again!

Elf: Like what?

SantaThinking: *[sighs and sits back on his rocking chair]* Like... Hmm...

%Suddenly, the North Pole begins to shake as if there's an earthquake!

ElfShocked: WH-WHAT THE?!

SantaShocked: An earthquake?! Here?! In the North Pole?!

@LOCATION: Hornet Man's Bedroom

HornetSleep: ZZzzz... 

GhostPresent: ...

HornetSleep: ZzzzZZzz...

GhostPresentAnnoyed: ...

HornetSleep: ZzZzzzZzz... ZzzzZZzz...

GhostPresentScared: ...

HornetSleep: ZZzzzZzZZzz...zzzzZzz... ZzZzzz... ZzzzzZZZzzzzz........

GhostPresentShocked: ...

HornetPissed: *[immediately gets up]* **AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!**

GhostPresentShocked: **AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!**

HornetSleep: *[immediately goes back to sleep]* Zzzzzzz...

GhostPresentAngry: HEY! *[kicks the bed]* Get up!!

HornetGlare: Zzzz... huh? What?

Hornet: ...

GhostPresentScared: ...

Hornet: Oh, I must be still dreaming about ghosts...

GhostPresentAngry: You're not! We're real and I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present!

HornetAnnoyed: Oh, god damn it.

GhostPresentAnnoyed: Anyways...!! Uhh... You're in the present now.

Hornet: ...

GhostPresentHappy: ...

HornetGlare: And?

GhostPresentScared: We're just really standing here. And that is what's going on in the present. Now I've hope you've learned your valuable lesson and become an upstanding citizen!

HornetAngry: The only valuable lesson I've learned is that you're an insufferable idiot prick. GET LOST!

GhostPresentShocked: EEP!! W-well... uh...! Bye!

%Plug Man dashes out of the room.

Hornet: *[deep sigh and goes back to sleep]*

SplashAnnoyed: ...

FakeAnnoyed: What even happened?

SplashAnnoyed: More like what didn't happened?!

GhostPresentAnnoyed: S-sorry, mon ami. I couldn't do it! He was just too intimidating to handle...

Galaxy0Happy: Oh! Don't worry, I've got a great idea as the next ghost!

GhostPresentHappy: Oh! Do tell!

Galaxy0: Well, we can't let the readers know! *[faces to the reader]* Why don't you tune in to the next scene first?

FakeShocked: Readers??

@LOCATION: The North Pole

SantaShocked: What in god's name is an earthquake doing around here?!

ElfShocked: What is that screaming?!

MagmaAngry: **RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!**

%Magma Man finally reaches to the surface of the North Pole. He pops out of the hole he just created several yards away from Santa's Workshop as a lava geyser spews out of the hole. As soon as he lands, he strikes a pose!

SantaShocked: HO HO HOLY SHIT!!

Elf: *[holds up a "10" card]*

Santa: *[holds up a "11" card]*

SpikeAloof: *[holds up a blank card]* ...

MagmaAnnoyed: ...*[shoots his magma bazooka at Concrete Man]*

SpikeAloof: *[blows up]*

MagmaGiddy: SANTAAAAA!!

SantaHappy: BILLY!!!!

MagmaAngry: My name is not Billy!!!

SantaSad: Sorry

MagmaHappy: Anyways, ol' Nick! I've came literally all the way from the other side of the planet to ask for a certain job position.

Santa: A job position?

Magma: Yeah, like a PR!

SantaThinking: Hmmm... Well, we don't have any job listings for a PR.

MagmaSad: Aw...

Santa: However! I think there are changes needed are in order... You can only do so much with doing the same thing after so many centuries, after all...

Magma: Oh?

SantaSad: Yeah! In fact... Christmas is hardly my holiday anymore. It used to be all about giving the gifts of joy to children and family everywhere...

SantaAngry: But now it's just an excuse for the commercialized industry to make 20x more money! I hardly get to make my own gifts to children anymore. We've gotta reclaim what was rightfully mine!

MagmaGiddy: *[fist pump]* Yeah! LET'S RECLAIM IT AND RENAME IT TO SINIMAS!

SantaShocked: Sinimas?!

MagmaHappy: Ya.

SantaThinking: Sounds threatening... They would have a hard time taking our holiday away from us again! I'll allow it!

ElfShocked: Are you sure you really want to do this?!

MagmaGiddy: HECK YEA!!

Santa: I don't see why not.

MagmaAngry: BEWARE COWARDS. WE ARE SINIMAS.
