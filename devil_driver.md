@ACTNUM: ACT I - PEP TALK

@LOCATIONlightslab: SYMPHONY CITY - GRAND PRIX GARAGE

@DATE: JUNE 14, 2X74 - Thirty minutes before the race

%A dark haired man in a racing suit stands in front of a red race car. His fingers etch themselves over the word ‘CERBERUS’ painted on the hood of the car.

Silver: Cerberus… Thanks for staying with me all these years. I promise I’ll bring home the gold for you again. I know you wouldn’t settle for any less.

Jewel Happy: Well, well, well! If it isn’t the Devil Driver himself! 

Silver Shocked: Huh? Hey Trish!

%A young woman with pink hair walks into the garage. 

Jewel Happy: Talking to your car again?

Silver Happy: Heh, just a pep talk. Gotta get Cerberus pumped up before the race. Can’t be sluggish for the Grand Prix.

Jewel Happy: Haha, I guess even a machine needs some encouragement sometimes. I’m sure those AI racers don’t get pep talks from their sponsors. Maybe that’s why you always win; Cerberus doesn’t want to let you down!

Silver Happy: Heh heh! Who needs AI when I’ve got you designing all my parts? Those robot racers have never been able to stand a chance.

Jewel Happy: Ah yeah, but car parts can only take you so far. It’s the driver that makes the difference. 

Silver Happy: Heh, you’re too modest. You and I both know I’m past my prime. I’ll bet ya I wouldn’t even be in the running if it wasn’t for your designs.

Jewel Shocked: I don’t know about that. But hey, when are you going to get your augmentations upgraded? I can’t believe you’re still winning races with that old second gen stuff…

Silver Annoyed: Hey, call me old fashioned all you want but I’ll take that over getting my brain liquified.

Jewel Angry: Oh come on, that’s such a geezer thing to say. Everyone knows the nosebleeds only happened to people who had overclocked black market implants. 

Silver Annoyed: Right…

Jewel Shocked: The official release augmentations are completely safe; they can increase your internal storage by twenty petabytes without any risk of brain damage. Not to mention it could improve your brain’s processing tenfold! Your reflexes would be insane! You’d be unstoppable!

Silver: Eh, I’d rather rely on my own intuition than robot parts. I can’t even say I’m entirely comfortable having second gen implants and I’ve had these since I was a kid.

Jewel Happy: Hahaha, you were born in the wrong century! You should be racing with a horse and wagon.

Silver Happy: Heh, I sure hope that wagon doesn’t catch fire when I saddle up the horse with nitrous boosts.

Jewel Angry: Oh jeez that poor hypothetical horse…

Tornado Angry: Eh Roy, we’re ready for ya. Get yer car on the track!

Silver Shocked: Gotcha, Harry! 

%Roy grabs his helmet from the roof of his car and hops in.

Silver Happy: Alright Trish, I’ll catch ya after the race. You get a good seat out there with the VIP tickets I gave you?

Jewel Happy: Front row like always!

Silver Happy: Good! I’ll be looking for ya in the audience.

Jewel Happy: Haha. You better come in first, old man!

Silver Happy: You know it, Trish! This old man can’t even count past one; that’s why I always come in first! See ya at the finish line!

%Roy puts on his helmet and drives off.

Jewel Happy: See ya at the finish line, Dad!

@ACTNUM: ACT II: REVIVAL

@LOCATION: ???

@DATE: OCTOBER 13, 2X77 - Three years after the race

%A young woman wearing an eyepatch works alone in a dark warehouse. Lab equipment can be seen scattered about as the room. She picks up a recorder with her mechanical arm. She rewinds the recorder and presses play.

Recorder: Day twelve. Roy is in stable condition now. Although his heart has stopped, I’ve determined that his augmentations have continued pumping blood throughout his body. This should keep him alive until I can complete the life support suit. However… I’ve found a defect in his augmentations. By my estimate, I only have about three years to finish the suit before his augmentations stop working. This should be more than enough time. Dad… hang in there. I promise I’ll save your life.

%The woman sighs deeply as she pinches the skin between her eyebrows with her free hand. She begins recording a new entry.

Jewel Relieved: Day one-thousand one-hundred fifty-six. Thirteenth attempt at resuscitation will begin. Final adjustments have been made and previous sources of failure have been accounted for. Now using geothermal energy source.

%She turns her attention towards a mechanical suit lying atop a table. Inside of the suit is the unconscious body of her father, Roy Jackson. 

Jewel Relieved: Beginning resuscitation.

%Trish turns off the recorder. Tears begin to stream out of her eyes as she lays her hand on the chest of the suit.

Jewel Sad: Dad… I promised I’d save you. It’s been more than three years and you’re still hanging on. I’m going to fulfill my promise today. You won’t have to hang on for much longer.

%A loud sound catches Trish’s attention. She turns her head towards a monitor and sees a flatline.

Jewel Angry: No! The augmentations are failing! Not today… not now! I’m so close! Please!

%She rushes to grab a tube and screws it into the chestplate of the suit as fast as she can. She runs over to a terminal and presses a button. The moment she does, magma surges through the tube and into the suit. The sound of a flatline remains constant.

Jewel Sad: Please! I can’t lose you! I need you, Dad!

%Trish sobs uncontrollably as she looks upon her father’s face. Suddenly, a steady rhythm of beeps begins to overtake the ambience of the room. Roy’s heart has begun beating again.

Jewel Shocked: Dad! I-I did it! You’re alive!

%Roy’s eyes snap open and he begins violently coughing.

Magma0 Angry: Gah!
